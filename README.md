## What is vim-mode?
An attempt at mimicking the 'mode' structure of emacs which activates syntax highlighting and more only by detecting the filetype.

This will allow you to enter into 'modes' upon will, activating certain plugins that are really good for developing in that langauge.
Upon entering into a mode, all of the specified plugins may not load simply because you may not have all the plugins (which is fine!).

As a result, this makes vim-plug faster to load upon startup.

*This plugin utlizes vim-plug and will not work if you don't have vim-plug.*
